Internet-Draft                 An Example                   October 2012


1.  Introduction


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Geolocation Information Feeds

3.1.  Specification

   Every feed should contain all IP addresses the provider wants to
   publish (instead of just a diff against some previous feed, e.g.
   containing only IP addresses whose location has changed).  Feeds MUST
   be in comma separated values format as described in [RFC4180].  Feeds
   MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding.  Text after a '#'
   character is treated as a comment only and ignored.  Blank lines are
   similarly ignored.  Each feed entry is of the form:
   IP_address_or_range,country,region,city,postal_code IP address fields
   are mandatory, the rest is optional (can be empty), though the
   requisite number of commas SHOULD be present.  Unparsable entries, in
   part or in full, SHOULD be discarded.  IP address field MUST be
   either: IP/CIDR e.g. 1.2.3.0/24 single IP address e.g. 1.2.3.4 CIDR
   IPv4 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632#section-3.1 IPv6
   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.3 Country field SHOULD
   be a 2 letter ISO country code
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), case-insensitive.
   Empty country fields or "ZZ" indicate unassigned reserved IPs.
   Region field should be a ISO region code
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) City field should be free
   text, excluding comma (',').  Postal code field should be free text,
   excluding comma (',').

3.2.  Examples

   Example entries using different IP address formats and describing
   locations at country, region, city and postal code granularity level,
   respectively: 192.0.2.0/25,US,US-AL,, 192.0.2.5,US,US-AL,Alabaster,
   192.0.2.128/25,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784 2001:db8:beef::/48,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784

4.  Finding Self-published IP Geolocation Feeds

Internet-Draft                 An Example                   October 2012


4.1.  Ad hoc 'well known' URIs

4.2.  Using 'reverse' DNS


5.  Acceptable Use Policies

   This incorporates no mechanism to communicate acceptable use policies
   for self-published data.  Publication itself is inferred as a desire
   by the publisher for the data to be freely consumed, similar to the
   publication of hostnames in the DNS.


6.  Security Considerations

   There is no true security in the obscurity of the location of any
   given IP address.  Publication of this data increases the ease with
   which such location data may be exploited, but fundamentally opens no
   new attack vectors.
