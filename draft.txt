                   Self-published IP Geolocation Data
                    draft-self-published-geo-00.txt

Abstract

   This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
   a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information,
   colloquially termed a geolocation "feed".  Consumers can poll and
   parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation data
   sources and procedures.

   Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one
   meeting location to the next have already experimentally published
   small geolocation feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has
   incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline.

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data       October 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   TODO(ek).

1.2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Self-published IP geolocation feeds

   TODO(ek).

2.1.  Specification

   For operational simplicity, every feed should contain data about all
   IP addresses the provider wants to publish.  Alternatives, like
   publishing only entries for IP addresses whose geolocation data has
   changed or differ from current observed geolocation behavior "at
   large", are likely to be too operationally complex.

   Feeds MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding.  Text after a '#'
   character is treated as a comment only and ignored.  Blank lines are
   similarly ignored.

   Feeds MUST be in comma separated values format as described in
   [RFC4180].  Each feed entry is a text line of the form:

       cidr_prefix,country,region,city,postal_code,delegation_size

   CIDR prefix fields are mandatory, all others are optional (can be
   empty), though the requisite minimum number of commas SHOULD be
   present.

2.1.1.  Geolocation feed individual entry fields

2.1.1.1.  CIDR prefix (or IP address)

   Mandatory.  Each CIDR prefix field MUST be either a single IP address
   or an IP prefix in CIDR notation in conformance with section 3.1 of
   [RFC4632] for IPv4 or section 2.3 of [RFC4291] for IPv6.

   Examples include "192.0.2.1" and "192.0.2.0/24" for IPv4 and "2001:
   db8::1" and "2001:db8::/32" for IPv6.

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data       October 2012


2.1.1.2.  Country

   Optional.  The country field SHOULD be a 2 letter ISO country code
   conforming to ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 [ISO.3166.1].  Parsers should treat
   this field case-insensitively.  Empty country fields or a country
   identifier of "ZZ" indicate unassigned reserved IPs for which other
   existing geolocation information can, from the perspective of the
   publisher, safely be discarded.

   Examples include "US" for the United States, "JP" for Japan, and "PL"
   for Poland.

2.1.1.3.  Region

   Optional.  The region field should be a ISO region code conforming to
   ISO 3166-2 [ISO.3166.2].  Parsers should treat this field case-
   insensitively.

   Examples include "ID-RI" for the Riau province of Indonesia and
   "NG-RI" for the Rivers province in Nigeria.

2.1.1.4.  City

   Optional.  The city field should be free text, excluding comma (',').

   Examples include "Dublin", "New York", and "Sao Paulo", specifically
   "S" followed by 0xc3, 0xa3, and "a Paulo".

2.1.1.5.  Postal code

   Optional.  The postal code field should be free text, excluding comma
   (',').

   Examples include "106-6126" (in Minato ward, Tokyo, Japan).

2.1.1.6.  Delegation size

   Optional.  A publisher may optionally communicate the average
   delegated prefix size for subnetworks within the IP prefix of this
   entry.  For a network operator this can used to help consumers
   distinguish IP prefixes among various use types such as residential
   prefixes, allocations to businesses, or data center customer
   allocations.

   Non-empty strings MUST be of the form required for CIDR notation
   suffixes, i.e. "/" followed by the integer prefix length allocation
   the subnetworks from within the entry's prefix.

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data       October 2012


   Examples include "/48", "/56", "/60", and "/64".

2.1.2.  Parsing and matching

   Entries which fail to parse, either in part or in full, SHOULD be
   discarded.  It is RECOMMENDED that they also be logged for further
   administrative review.

   When parsing and matching, consumers MUST NOT attempt to use simple
   string matching or regular expressions but instead MUST parse IP
   address and CIDR string representations into IP prefixes and perform
   set membership tests.  While publishers SHOULD follow [RFC5952] style
   for IPv6 addresses, consumers MUST nevertheless accept all valid
   string representations.

   Multiple entries which constitute nested prefixes are permitted.
   Consumers SHOULD consider the entry with the longest matching prefix
   (i.e. the "most specific") to be the best matching entry for any
   given IP address.

   Duplicate IP address or prefix entries SHOULD be considered an error,
   and consumer implementations SHOULD log the repeated entries for
   further administrative review and MAY either discard or overwrite
   prior duplicate entries with subsequent data.  Publishers MUST NOT
   rely upon any individual implementation's behavior and instead SHOULD
   take measures to ensure there is one and only one entry per IP
   address and per prefix.

2.2.  Examples

   Example entries using different IP address formats and describing
   locations at country, region, city and postal code granularity level,
   respectively:

       192.0.2.0/25,US,US-AL,,,
       192.0.2.5,US,US-AL,Alabaster,,
       192.0.2.128/25,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784,
       2001:db8::/32,PL,,,,
       2001:db8:cafe::/48,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784,/56

   Experimentally, RIPE has published geolocation information for their
   meeting network prefixes, which change location in accordance with
   each new meeting.  [RIPE_NCC_GEO] at the time of writing contains:

       193.0.24.0/21,IE,IE-D,Dublin,
       2001:67c:64::/48,IE,IE-D,Dublin,

   Similarly, ICANN has published geolocation information for their

   portable meeting network prefixes.  [ICANN_GEO] at the time of
   writing contains:

       199.91.192.0/21,US,US-CA,Los Angeles,
       2620:f:8000::/48,US,US-CA,Los Angeles,


3.  Finding self-published IP geolocation feeds

   TODO(ek).

   The integrity of published information SHOULD be protected by
   securing the means of publication, for example by using HTTP over TLS
   [RFC2818].  Whenever possible, consumers SHOULD prefer retrieving
   geolocation feeds in a manner that guarantees integrity of the feed.

3.1.  Ad hoc 'well known' URIs

   TODO(ek).

3.2.  Publishing URIs in whois

   TODO(ek).

3.3.  Using 'reverse' DNS

   TODO(ek): document crazy _geo.4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa TXT record format
   that basically returns "v=1 https://example.net/ipgeo/v1.csv".  Also:
   can ask the root of the zone in the SOA.


4.  Consuming self-published IP geolocation feeds

4.1.  Acceptable use implied

   This proposal does not incorporate a mechanism to communicate
   acceptable use policies for self-published data.  Publication itself
   is inferred as a desire by the publisher for the data to be usefully
   consumed, similar to the publication of information like hostnames,
   cryptographic keys, and SPF records [RFC4408] in the DNS.

4.2.  Trust and verification

   Consumers of self-published IP geolocation feeds SHOULD perform some
   form of verification that the publisher is in fact authoritative for
   the addresses in the feed.  The actual means of verification is
   dependent upon the way in which the feed is discovered.  Ad hoc
   shared URIs, for example, will likely require an ad hoc verification



Kline & Duleba             Expires May 2, 2013                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data       October 2012


   process.  Automated means of feed discovery SHOULD have an
   accompanying automated means of verification.

   A consumer MUST only trust geolocation information for IP addresses
   or ranges for which the publisher has been verified as
   administratively authoritative.  All other geolocation feed entries
   MUST be ignored and SHOULD be logged for further administrative
   review.

4.3.  Refreshing feed information

   As a publisher can change geolocation data at any time and without
   notification consumers SHOULD implement mechanisms to periodically
   refresh local copies of feed data.  If the feed discovery mechanism
   offers hints about data validity time (e.g. the TTL field of the DNS
   Resource Record which identified a feed (section 3.2.1 of
   [RFC1035])), then the given feed SHOULD be refreshed before the
   expiration of this validity timer.

   For feeds available via HTTPS (or HTTP), the publisher MAY
   communicate refresh timing information by means of the standard HTTP
   expiration model (section 13.2 of [RFC2616]).  Specifically,
   publishers can include either an Expires header or a Cache-Control
   header specifying the max-age.  Where practical, consumers SHOULD
   refresh feed information before the expiry time is reached.

   In the absence of any other refresh timing information it is
   recommended that consumers SHOULD refresh feeds no less often than
   weekly.


5.  Security Considerations

   As there is no true security in the obscurity of the location of any
   given IP address, self-publication of this data fundamentally opens
   no new attack vectors.  Self-published data merely increases the ease
   with which such location data might be exploited.


6.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to express their gratitude to reviewers and
   early implementers, including but not limited to Mikael Abrahamsson,
   Richard L. Barnes, Marco Hogewoning, Menno Schepers, and Bjoern A.
