Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data       October 2012


1.  Introduction


2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Geolocation Information Feeds

3.1.  Specification

   For operational simplicity, every feed should contain data about all
   IP addresses the provider wants to publish.  Alternatives, like
   publishing only entries for IP addresses whose geolocation data has
   changed or differ from current observed geolocation behavior "at
   large", are likely to be too operationally complex.

   Feeds MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding.  Text after a '#'
   character is treated as a comment only and ignored.  Blank lines are
   similarly ignored.

   Feeds MUST be in comma separated values format as described in
   [RFC4180].  Each feed entry is a text line of the form:

      IP_address_or_cidr,country,region,city,postal_code

   IP address fields are mandatory, the rest is optional (can be empty),
   though the requisite minimum number of commas SHOULD be present.

   Unparsable entries, in part or in full, SHOULD be discarded.

   TODO(ek): longest matching prefix; also MUST use IP address matching,
   not string matching.

   TODO(ek): exact duplicate entries are erroneous, and consumer
   implementations MAY discard or overwrite prior duplicate entries with
   subsequent data.  Publisher MUST NOT rely upon any implementation-
   dependent behavior and instead SHOULD take measures to ensure one and
   only one entry per prefix.

3.1.1.  IP address field

   Each IP address field MUST be either a single IP address or an IP
   prefix in CIDR notation in conformance with section 3.1 of [RFC4632]
   for IPv4 or section 2.3 of [RFC4291] for IPv6.

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data       October 2012


   Examples include "192.0.2.1" and "192.0.2.0/24" for IPv4 and "2001:
   db8::1" and "2001:db8::/32" for IPv6.

3.1.2.  Country field

   The country field SHOULD be a 2 letter ISO country code conforming to
   ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 ([ISO_3166_1]).  Parsers should treat this field
   case-insensitively.  Empty country fields or a country identifier of
   "ZZ" indicate unassigned reserved IPs for which other existing
   geolocation information can, from the perspective of the publisher,
   safely be discarded.

   Examples include "US" for the United States, "JP" for Japan, and "PL"
   for Poland.

3.1.3.  Region field

   Region field should be a ISO region code conforming to ISO 3166-2
   ([ISO_3166_2]).  Parsers should treat this field case-insensitively.

   Examples include "ID-RI" for the Riau province of Indonesia and
   "NG-RI" for the Rivers province in Nigeria.

3.1.4.  City field

   City field should be free text, excluding comma (',').

   Examples include "Dublin", "New York", and "Sao Paulo".

3.1.5.  Postal code field

   Postal code field should be free text, excluding comma (',').

   Examples include "106-6126" (in Minato ward, Tokyo, Japan).

3.2.  Examples

   Example entries using different IP address formats and describing
   locations at country, region, city and postal code granularity level,
   respectively:

       192.0.2.0/25,US,US-AL,,
       192.0.2.5,US,US-AL,Alabaster,
       192.0.2.128/25,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784
       2001:db8:cafe::/48,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784

   Speculatively, RIPE has published geolocation information for their
   meeting network prefixes, which change location in accordance with

   each new meeting.  [RIPE_NCC_GEO] at the time of writing contains:

       193.0.24.0/21,IE,IE-D,Dublin,
       2001:67c:64::/48,IE,IE-D,Dublin,


4.  Finding Self-published IP Geolocation Feeds

4.1.  Ad hoc 'well known' URIs

4.2.  Publishing URIs in whois

4.3.  Using 'reverse' DNS

   TODO(ek): document crazy _geo.4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa TXT record format
   that basically returns "v=1 https://example.net/ipgeo/v1.csv".  Also:
   can ask the root of the zone in the SOA.


5.  Use Policies

   This incorporates no mechanism to communicate acceptable use policies
   for self-published data.  Publication itself is inferred as a desire
   by the publisher for the data to be freely consumed, similar to the
   publication of hostnames in the DNS.

   TODO(ek): That having been said, there are implications of trusting
   geolocation for IP addresses for which the publishing authority is
   not authoritative.  Comment about "caveat emptor".


6.  Security Considerations

   There is no true security in the obscurity of the location of any
   given IP address.  Publication of this data increases the ease with
   which such location data may be exploited, but fundamentally opens no
   new attack vectors.
