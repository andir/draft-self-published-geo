Abstract

   TODO(ek): proper IPR selection

   TODO(ek): add Krzysztof's code

   TODO(ek): spell check!

   This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
   a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information,
   colloquially termed a geolocation "feed".  Interested parties can
   poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation
   data sources and procedures.

   Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one
   meeting location to the next have already experimentally published
   small geolocation feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has
   incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline.

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data      November 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Motivation

   Providers of services over the Internet have grown to depend on best-
   effort geolocation information to improve the user experience.
   Locality information can aid in directing traffic to the nearest
   serving location, inferring likely native language, and providing
   additional context for services involving search queries.

   When a network provider changes the location of an IP prefix,
   services which may use of geolocation information may begin to suffer
   worse performance.  This can lead to customer complaints, possibly to
   the network provider directly.  Resolution of incorrect geolocation
   data is complicated by the lack of any centralized means to
   coordinate and communicate location information to all interested
   consumers of the data.

   This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish
   a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information,
   colloquially termed a "geolocation feed".  Interested parties can
   poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation
   data sources and procedures.

   Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one
   meeting location to the next have already experimentally published
   small geolocation feeds.  At least one consumer (Google) has
   incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline.

1.2.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

1.3.  Acceptable use implied

   This proposal does not incorporate a mechanism to communicate
   acceptable use policies for self-published data.  Publication itself
   is inferred as a desire by the publisher for the data to be usefully
   consumed, similar to the publication of information like hostnames,
   cryptographic keys, and SPF records [RFC4408] in the DNS.


2.  Self-published IP geolocation feeds

   The format described here was developed to address the need of
   network operators to rapidly and usefully share geolocation



Kline, et al.             Expires May 10, 2013                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data      November 2012


   information changes.  Originally, there arose a specific case where
   regional operators found it desirable to publish location changes
   rather than wait for geolocation algorithms to "learn" about them.
   Later on technical conferences, which frequently use the same network
   prefixes advertised from different meeting locations, experimented by
   publishing geolocation changes in advance of need in order to better
   serve conference attendees.

   At its simplest, the mechanism consists of a network provider
   publishing a file (the "geolocation feed"), which contains several
   text entries, one per line.  Each entry is keyed by a unique (within
   the feed) IP prefix (or single IP address) followed by a sequence of
   network locality attributes to be ascribed to the given prefix.

2.1.  Specification

   For operational simplicity, every feed should contain data about all
   IP addresses the provider wants to publish.  Alternatives, like
   publishing only entries for IP addresses whose geolocation data has
   changed or differ from current observed geolocation behavior "at
   large", are likely to be too operationally complex.

   Feeds MUST use UTF-8 [RFC3629] character encoding.  Text after a '#'
   character is treated as a comment only and ignored.  Blank lines are
   similarly ignored.

   Feeds MUST be in comma separated values format as described in
   [RFC4180].  Each feed entry is a text line of the form:

       ip_range,country,region,city,postal_code

   IP range fields are REQUIRED, all others are OPTIONAL (can be empty),
   though the requisite minimum number of commas SHOULD be present.

2.1.1.  Geolocation feed individual entry fields

2.1.1.1.  IP Range

   Mandatory.  Each IP range field MUST be either a single IP address or
   an IP prefix in CIDR notation in conformance with section 3.1 of
   [RFC4632] for IPv4 or section 2.3 of [RFC4291] for IPv6.

   Examples include "192.0.2.1" and "192.0.2.0/24" for IPv4 and "2001:
   db8::1" and "2001:db8::/32" for IPv6.  Additionally, IPv4 ranges
   (only) may be expressed in form "192.0.2.3-192.0.2.25".

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data      November 2012


2.1.1.2.  Country

   OPTIONAL.  The country field SHOULD be a 2 letter ISO country code
   conforming to ISO 3166-1 alpha 2 [ISO.3166.1].  Parsers should treat
   this field case-insensitively.

   Empty country fields or a country identifier of "ZZ" indicate either
   unassigned reserved IP ranges or IP ranges for which existing
   geolocation information can, from the perspective of the publisher,
   safely be discarded.  Section 4 contains advice to consumers of this
   data.

   Examples include "US" for the United States, "JP" for Japan, and "PL"
   for Poland.

2.1.1.3.  Region

   OPTIONAL.  The region field should be a ISO region code conforming to
   ISO 3166-2 [ISO.3166.2].  Parsers should treat this field case-
   insensitively.

   Examples include "ID-RI" for the Riau province of Indonesia and
   "NG-RI" for the Rivers province in Nigeria.

2.1.1.4.  City

   OPTIONAL.  The city field should be free text, excluding comma (',').

   Examples include "Dublin", "New York", and "Sao Paulo", specifically
   "S" followed by 0xc3, 0xa3, and "o Paulo".

2.1.1.5.  Postal code

   OPTIONAL.  The postal code field should be free text, excluding comma
   (',').

   Examples include "106-6126" (in Minato ward, Tokyo, Japan).

2.1.2.  Parsing and matching

   Entries with expected fields which fail to parse, either in part or
   in full, SHOULD be discarded.  It is RECOMMENDED that they also be
   logged for further administrative review.  For compatibility with
   future additional fields a parser MUST ignore any fields beyond those
   it expects.  The data from fields which are expected and which parse
   successfully MUST still be considered valid.

   When parsing and matching, consumers MUST NOT attempt to use simple



Kline, et al.             Expires May 10, 2013                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data      November 2012


   string matching or regular expressions but instead MUST parse IP
   address and CIDR string representations into IP prefixes and perform
   set membership tests.  While publishers SHOULD follow [RFC5952] style
   for IPv6 addresses, consumers MUST nevertheless accept all valid
   string representations.

   Multiple entries which constitute nested prefixes are permitted.
   Consumers SHOULD consider the entry with the longest matching prefix
   (i.e. the "most specific") to be the best matching entry for any
   given IP address.

   Duplicate IP address or prefix entries SHOULD be considered an error,
   and consumer implementations SHOULD log the repeated entries for
   further administrative review and MAY either discard or overwrite
   prior duplicate entries with subsequent data.  Publishers MUST NOT
   rely upon any individual implementation's behavior and instead SHOULD
   take measures to ensure there is one and only one entry per IP
   address and per prefix.

2.2.  Examples

   Example entries using different IP address formats and describing
   locations at country, region, city and postal code granularity level,
   respectively:

       192.0.2.0/25,US,US-AL,,
       192.0.2.5,US,US-AL,Alabaster,
       192.0.2.128/25,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784
       2001:db8::/32,PL,,,
       2001:db8:cafe::/48,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784

   Experimentally, RIPE has published geolocation information for their
   meeting network prefixes, which change location in accordance with
   each new meeting.  [GEO_RIPE_NCC] at the time of writing contains:

       193.0.24.0/21,IE,IE-D,Dublin,
       2001:67c:64::/48,IE,IE-D,Dublin,

   Similarly, ICANN has published geolocation information for their
   portable meeting network prefixes.  [GEO_ICANN] at the time of
   writing contains:

       199.91.192.0/21,US,US-CA,Los Angeles,
       2620:f:8000::/48,US,US-CA,Los Angeles,

2.3.  Proposed extensions

   Already some discussions have resulted in proposed extensions.  While
   the purpose of this document is principally to record existing
   implementation details, it may be that there is a larger desire to
   publish other "network attributes" in a similar manner.  One such
   network attribute, "delegation size", is not currently implemented
   but the state of the proposed extension is recorded here to
   demonstrate the flexibility required of parser implementations.

2.3.1.  Delegation size

   OPTIONAL.  A publisher may optionally communicate the average
   delegated prefix size for subnetworks within the IP prefix of this
   entry.  For a network operator this can be used to help consumers
   distinguish IP prefixes among various use types such as residential
   prefixes, allocations to businesses, or data center customer
   allocations.

   Non-empty strings MUST be of the form required for CIDR notation
   suffixes, i.e. "/" followed by the integer prefix length of the
   expected allocation to the subnetworks from within the entry's
   prefix.  In the absence of data to the contrary, it is common to
   assume that leaf networks may be delegated a prefix ranging from /24
   to /32 in IPv4 and /48 to /64 in IPv6.  Default assumptions about
   delegation size are left to the consumer's implementation.

   Examples include "/48", "/56", "/60", and "/64".

2.3.2.  IPv4 hyphenated range format

   OPTIONAL.  Due to the density of some IPv4 allocations in some
   networks it may be more convenient to list IP ranges in an alternate,
   hyphenated form.  IPv4 ranges, and only IPv4 ranges, MAY be formatted
   as "start_address-end_address", indicating that all IPv4 addresses
   from the start address incrementing numerically through the end
   address inclusive constitute the IP range for the given entry.

   Publishers MUST prefer CIDR notation over this hyphenated alternative
   if a collection of CIDR IP ranges can reasonably be constructed that
   expresses the equivalent of the hyphenated range.

   Due of the complexity of constructing a valid IP range and address
   mapping to geolocation entries, this hyphenated form has some
   additional restrictions:

   o  All IPv4 hyphenated ranges MUST be disjoint with each other (no
      overlapping ranges).



Kline, et al.             Expires May 10, 2013                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data      November 2012


   o  All IPv4 hyphenated ranges MUST be a proper subset of any covering
      IPv4 CIDR prefix (no cutting across CIDR boundaries).

   Examples include expressions of the form "192.0.2.3-192.0.2.25".


3.  Finding self-published IP geolocation feeds

   The issue of finding, and later verifying, geolocation feeds is not
   specifically addressed in this document.  At this time, only ad hoc
   feed location and verification has a modicum of established practice
   (see below).  Regardless, both the ad hoc mechanics and a few
   proposed but not yet implemented alternatives are discussed.

3.1.  Ad hoc 'well known' URIs

   To date, geolocation feeds have been shared informally in the form of
   HTTP URIs exchanged in email threads.  The two example URIs
   documented above describe networks that change locations
   periodically, the operators and operational practices of which are
   well known within their respective technical communities.

   The contents of the feeds are verified by a similarly ad hoc process
   including:

   o  personal knowledge of the parties involved in the exchange, and

   o  comparison of feed-advertised prefixes with the BGP-advertised
      prefixes of Autonomous System Numbers known to be operated by the
      publishers.

   Ad hoc mechanisms, while useful for early experimentation by
   producers and consumers, are unlikely to be adequate for long-term,
   widespread use by multiple parties.  Future versions of any such
   self-published geolocation feed mechanism SHOULD address scalability
   concerns by incorporating a means for automated discovery and
   verification of operational authority of advertised prefixes.

3.2.  Using public databases of network authority

   One possibility for enabling automation would be publication of feed
   URIs as a well-known attribute in public databases of network
   authority, e.g. the whois service ([RFC3912]) operated by RIRs.
   Verification may be performed if the same or similarly authoritative
   service provides the identical feed URI for queries for each entry's
   CIDR prefix.

   The burden of serving this data to all interested consumers,



Kline, et al.             Expires May 10, 2013                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data      November 2012


   especially the load imposed by any verification process, is not yet
   known.  The anticipation of additional operational burden on the
   public resource of record is noted however.

3.3.  Using 'reverse' DNS

   Another possibility for automating the location and verification of a
   feed is to incorporate feed URIs into the DNS, specifically the in-
   addr.arpa and ip6.arpa portions of the DNS hierarchy.  A suitably
   formatted query for a TXT record that would return an answer in a
   well-known format, e.g. "v=1 https://example.net/ipgeo/v1.csv", could
   suffice.

   Attempts to locate the geolocation feed for a given IP address would
   begin by querying directly for a TXT record associated with the PTR-
   style name prefixed by "_geo.".  For example, 192.0.2.4 and 2001:
   db8::6 would cause a TXT record request to be issued for
   "_geo.4.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa" and "_geo.6.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0
   .0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa", respectively.

   If no such record exists one further query for the fully qualified
   domainname of the SOA record in the authority section of the response
   to the previous query, similarly prefixed with "_geo.", would be
   performed ("_geo.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa" and
   "_geo.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa" in the examples above).  Successfully
   located feed URIs could then be processed as outlined by this
   document, possibly taking in to the consider the TTL of the
   successful response for refresh timing information.

   Verification of the contents of a feed would proceed in essentially
   the same way.  CIDR prefixes may be verified by constructing a query
   for any single address (at random) within the prefix and proceeding
   as above.  While not strictly provably correct (in cases where a
   publisher has delegated some portion of the advertised prefix but not
   excluded it from its feed), it may nevertheless suffice for
   operational purposes, especially if a low-impact on-going
   verification of observed client IP addresses is implemented, to
   (eventually) catch any oversights.

   This mode is untested and may prove impractical.  However, the
   operational burden is more closely located with those wishing and
   willing to bear it, i.e. the publishers who would likely handle
   serving in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa for the IP prefixes under their
   authority.

4.  Consuming self-published IP geolocation feeds

   While consumers MAY treat published feed data as a hint only and MAY
   choose to prefer other sources of geolocation information for any
   given IP range there are some guidelines for sensibly and effectively
   consuming published feeds.

4.1.  Feed integrity

   The integrity of published information SHOULD be protected by
   securing the means of publication, for example by using HTTP over TLS
   [RFC2818].  Whenever possible, consumers SHOULD prefer retrieving
   geolocation feeds in a manner that guarantees integrity of the feed.

4.2.  Verification of authority

   Consumers of self-published IP geolocation feeds SHOULD perform some
   form of verification that the publisher is in fact authoritative for
   the addresses in the feed.  The actual means of verification is
   dependent upon the way in which the feed is discovered.  Ad hoc
   shared URIs, for example, will likely require an ad hoc verification
   process.  Automated means of feed discovery SHOULD have an
   accompanying automated means of verification.

   A consumer MUST only trust geolocation information for IP addresses
   or ranges for which the publisher has been verified as
   administratively authoritative.  All other geolocation feed entries
   MUST be ignored and SHOULD be logged for further administrative
   review.

4.3.  Verification of accuracy

   Errors and inaccuracies may occur at many levels, and publication and
   consumption of geolocation data are no exceptions.  To the extent
   practical consumers SHOULD take steps to verify the accuracy of
   published locality.  Verification methodology, resolution of
   discrepancies, and preference for alternative sources of data are
   left to the discretion of the consumer.

   Consumers SHOULD decide on discrepancy thresholds and SHOULD flag for
   administrative review feed entries which exceed set thresholds.

4.4.  Refreshing feed information

   As a publisher can change geolocation data at any time and without
   notification consumers SHOULD implement mechanisms to periodically
   refresh local copies of feed data.  If the feed discovery mechanism
   offers hints about data validity time (e.g. the TTL field of the DNS



Kline, et al.             Expires May 10, 2013                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     Self-published IP Geolocation Data      November 2012


   Resource Record which identified a feed (section 3.2.1 of
   [RFC1035])), then the given feed SHOULD be refreshed before the
   expiration of this validity timer.

   For feeds available via HTTPS (or HTTP), the publisher MAY
   communicate refresh timing information by means of the standard HTTP
   expiration model (section 13.2 of [RFC2616]).  Specifically,
   publishers can include either an Expires header or a Cache-Control
   header specifying the max-age.  Where practical, consumers SHOULD
   refresh feed information before the expiry time is reached.

   In the absence of any other refresh timing information it is
   recommended that consumers SHOULD refresh feeds no less often than
   weekly.


5.  Security Considerations

   As there is no true security in the obscurity of the location of any
   given IP address, self-publication of this data fundamentally opens
   no new attack vectors.  For publishers, self-published data merely
   increases the ease with which such location data might be exploited.

   For consumers, feed retrieval processes may receive input from
   potentially hostile sources (e.g. in the event of hijacked traffic).
   As such, proper input validation and defense measures MUST be taken.

   Similarly, consumers who do not perform sufficient verification of
   published data bear the same risks as from other forms of geolocation
   configuration errors.
