2.  Specification

   Every feed should contain all IP addresses the provider wants to give
   us (instead of just a diff against previous feed, ie. containing only
   IP addresses whose location changed) Feeds MUST be in comma separated
   values format as described in RFC 4180.  Feeds MUST use UTF-8
   character encoding.  Each feed entry is of the form: IP address/
   range,country,region,city,postal code IP address fields are
   mandatory, the rest is optional (can be empty).  Unparsable entries,
   in part or in full, SHOULD be discarded.  IP address field MUST be
   either: IP/CIDR e.g. 1.2.3.0/24 single IP address e.g. 1.2.3.4
   Country field SHOULD be a 2 letter ISO country code
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), case-insensitive.
   Empty country fields or "ZZ" indicate unassigned reserved IPs.
   Region field should be a ISO region code
   (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) City field should be free
   text (excluding ",").  Postal code field should be free text
   (excluding ",").
