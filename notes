Specification

Every feed should contain all IP addresses the provider wants to give us (instead of just a diff against previous feed, ie. containing only IP addresses whose location changed)

Feeds MUST be in comma separated values format as described in RFC 4180.
Feeds MUST use UTF-8 character encoding.

Each feed entry is of the form:
    IP address/range,country,region,city,postal code

IP address fields are mandatory, the rest is optional (can be empty).
Unparsable entries, in part or in full, SHOULD be discarded.

IP address field MUST be either:
    IP/CIDR e.g. 1.2.3.0/24
    single IP address e.g. 1.2.3.4

Country field SHOULD be a 2 letter ISO country code
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), case-insensitive.  Empty
country fields or "ZZ" indicate unassigned reserved IPs.

Region field should be a ISO region code
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)

City field should be free text (excluding ",").

Postal code field should be free text (excluding ",").


Examples

Example entries using different IP address formats and describing locations
at country, region, city and postal code granularity level, respectively:
192.0.2.0/25,US,US-AL,,
