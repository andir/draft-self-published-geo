    <section title="Specification">
      <t>
Every feed should contain all IP addresses the provider wants to give us
(instead of just a diff against previous feed, ie. containing only IP
addresses whose location changed)

Feeds MUST be in comma separated values format as described in RFC 4180.
Feeds MUST use UTF-8 character encoding.

Each feed entry is of the form:
    IP address/range,country,region,city,postal code

IP address fields are mandatory, the rest is optional (can be empty).
Unparsable entries, in part or in full, SHOULD be discarded.

IP address field MUST be either:
    IP/CIDR e.g. 1.2.3.0/24
    single IP address e.g. 1.2.3.4

Country field SHOULD be a 2 letter ISO country code
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), case-insensitive.  Empty
country fields or "ZZ" indicate unassigned reserved IPs.

Region field should be a ISO region code
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)

City field should be free text (excluding ",").

Postal code field should be free text (excluding ",").
