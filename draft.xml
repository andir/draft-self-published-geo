    <section title="Requirements notation">
      <t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.

    <section title="Geolocation Information Feeds">
      <section title="Specification">
        <t>
Every feed should contain all IP addresses the provider wants to publish
(instead of just a diff against some previous feed, e.g. containing only IP
addresses whose location has changed).

Feeds MUST be in comma separated values format as described in
<xref target="RFC4180"/>.
Feeds MUST use UTF-8 <xref target="RFC3629"/> character encoding.
Text after a '#' character is treated as a comment only and ignored.
Blank lines are similarly ignored.

Each feed entry is of the form:
    IP_address_or_range,country,region,city,postal_code

IP address fields are mandatory, the rest is optional (can be empty), though
the requisite number of commas SHOULD be present.

Unparsable entries, in part or in full, SHOULD be discarded.

IP address field MUST be either:
    IP/CIDR e.g. 1.2.3.0/24
    single IP address e.g. 1.2.3.4

CIDR
    IPv4 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4632#section-3.1
    IPv6 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.3

Country field SHOULD be a 2 letter ISO country code
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2), case-insensitive.  Empty
country fields or "ZZ" indicate unassigned reserved IPs.

Region field should be a ISO region code
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)

City field should be free text, excluding comma (',').

Postal code field should be free text, excluding comma (',').
        </t>

      <section title="Examples">
        <t>
Example entries using different IP address formats and describing locations
at country, region, city and postal code granularity level, respectively:
192.0.2.0/25,US,US-AL,,
192.0.2.5,US,US-AL,Alabaster,
192.0.2.128/25,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784
2001:db8:beef::/48,PL,PL-MZ,,02-784

    <section title="Acceptable Use Policies">
      <t>
This incorporates no mechanism to communicate acceptable use policies for
self-published data.  Publication itself is inferred as a desire by the
publisher for the data to be freely consumed, similar to the publication of
hostnames in the DNS.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
There is no true security in the obscurity of the location of any given IP
address.  Publication of this data increases the ease with which such
location data may be exploited, but fundamentally opens no new attack
vectors.
